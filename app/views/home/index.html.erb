    <p > Charity is the act of helping the needy by providing them with sources that can be useful for them. Charity is one of the most generous acts. The greatest thing about charity is that it doesnâ€™t always need to be big. But it is one of the toughest tasks to do. Cyc is an open-source project free for contribution and is constantly looking for well-wishers willing to fronteer this mission.</p>

    <p>We have broken it down for you here. You can be sure that your money is going to the person you intended it for.</p>
    <p>Please note that no finances or physical goods go to CyC directly. CyC publishes stories and the donor/wellwisher chooses to contact the owner directly at their own judgement.</p>
